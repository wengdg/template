As the Internet continues to consume our daily lives, it is only natural that relationships are formed online.  Although the term "friend" may be defined differently amongst individuals, classical definitions such as that attributed by Aristotle restrict true friends to face-to-face interactions.  This definition continues to evolve, though, and the criteria for friendship has changed considerably throughout time and technology.  This study on online friendship was conducted as part of the final project for ICS 668: Social Informatics.  A survey was created and posted on Amazon Turk for individuals to answer, and consisted of questions that concerned the relationship between offline and online friendships.
