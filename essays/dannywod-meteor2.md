# DannyWOD: Form Extension

For this DannyWOD, you will modify meteor-example-form so that the Create Student Data page will also have a selection box in which students can select the year that they are planning to graduate.  You will then test this selection box by adding a new student and viewing the document within Mongo.  Here is an example of the extra selection box:

## The WOD

Ready? Let's begin:

### Run meteor-example-form

 1. Create a GitHub repository called form-extension and clone it to your local file system.

 2. Import the [meteor-example-form](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-example-form/) code into your local form-extension repo:

    * Download the zip version of meteor-example-form and extract everything but the README.md file into form-extension.
    * cd into form-extension/app and run `meteor npm install`.
    * Then run `meteor npm run start`.
    * Direct your browser to localhost:3000 to test that the application runs correctly

 3. Create a "Static Web" Intellij project called form-extension that points to your repo.

 4. Set up your project to use our [Javascript coding standards](../coding-standards/reading-javascript-coding-standards.html). In a nutshell:
   
    * Select the [ics-se-code-style.xml]({{ site.baseurl }}/morea/development-environments/ics-se-code-style.xml) preferences template (Preferences > Editor > Code Style).
    * Disable IntelliJ Javascript Inspections (Preferences > Editor > Inspections > Javascript).
    * Define the Javascript Language as ECMAScript6 (Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Javascript)
    * Enable ESLint (Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Javascript > Code Quality Tools > ESLint). Specify the ESLint package as the one occurring in app/node_modules/eslint.

### Add working selection box to form

 1. Modify /ui/pages/create-student-data-page.html:

    * Reference another Select\_Form\_Control template, which goes after the *Majors* select form template.  Add label="Grad Year", options=years, and an error message. 

 2. Modify /ui/pages/create-student-data-page.js:

    * In the section with the form field structures (arrays with labels), export a const named *yearList* which contains the strings '2017', '2018', and '2019'.
    * Add a helper function called *years* which maps a label to each year in *yearList*.
    * Within the events section, add a const named *year* which retrieves the user selection when the form is submitted.
    * In *newStudentData*, add *year* to the end of the list.

 3. Modify /api/studentdata/studentdata.js:
    
    * Add a key *year* to the schema, with label set to 'Year' and type set to String.  

### Test the new selection box

 1. Your form should now show a selection box with the label *Grad Year*, and dropdown options of 2017, 2018, and 2019.  

 2. Fill out and submit the form, making sure to select a graduation year.  Do not do any further edits at this time.

 3. In the app directory, run `meteor mongo` and use `db.StudentData.find()` to check that your submitted document is present, along with the year key.  

### Save your changes to GitHub.

 1. Once youâ€™ve finished, commit your changes to GitHub, and check to see that your changes are there.

 2. Raise your hand to notify me that you are done.
